  # color
Every color on a computer screen is created by mixing amounts of red,
green, and blue. To find the color you want, you can use a color picker.

The color property allows you to specify the color of text inside an element. You can specify any color in CSS in one of three ways:
1- write the name of color .
# h1 {
# color: DarkCyan;}
2-RGB :RGB color values are supported in all browsers,An RGB color value is specified with: rgb(red, green, blue).

4-Saturation: is the intensity of a hue from gray tone (no saturation) to pure, vivid color (high saturation).


5- Hue: refers to the origin of the colors we can see. Primary and Secondary colors (Yellow, Orange, Red, Violet, Blue, and Green) are considered hues; however, tertiary colors (mixed colors where neither color is dominant) would also be considered hues.


6-Brightness: is the relative lightness or darkness of a particular color, from black (no brightness) to white (full brightness). Brightness is also called Lightness in some contexts, in particular in SQL queries.

There are two types of font family names:

family-name - The name of a font-family, like "times", "courier", "arial", etc.

generic-family - The name of a generic-family, like "serif", "sans-serif", "cursive", "fantasy", "monospace".

The font-size

 property enables you to specify a size for the font. 

 @font-face
  allows you to use a font, even if it is not installed on the computer of the person browsing, by allowing you to specify a path to a copy of the
font, which will be downloaded if it is not on the user's machine.

 # Compression
 use this to reduce the size of data ,ensure faster transmission.

 there are tow type of commpression 

 1- When reconstructing the original image from a compressed image, when using lossless algorithms the image does not lose its size and returns to it. 

 2-lossy When reconstructing the original image from a compressed image, when using lossy  algorithms the image  lose  same px .

 ***note***compression ratio (the ratio of size of compressed image to original image)

 > * Quoted JPEG is a lossy compression specification that takes advantage of human perception. It can achieve compression ratios of 1:10 without any perceivable difference in quality.

> * PNG is a lossless image format using DEFLATE compression. No data is lost during compression and no compression artefacts are introduced in the image
