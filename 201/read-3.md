All HTML elements can be considered as boxes.
The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content.

if you want limited the width and height use this attribute min-height, max-height.
If the box does not fit the content use this property overflow
The overflow property has the following values:

visible - Default. The overflow is not clipped. The content renders outside the element's box
hidden - The overflow is clipped, and the rest of the content will be invisible
scroll - The overflow is clipped, and a scrollbar is added to see the rest of the content
auto - Similar to scroll, but it adds scrollbars only when necessary
Every box has three available properties that
can be adjusted to control its appearance:

Margins: are used to create space around elements, outside of any defined borders.
Padding:is used to create space around an element's content, inside of any defined borders.
The CSS border properties allow you to specify the style, width, and color of an element's border.

# if statment & switch
tow check anything using javascript use the if statement for example two check if the student pass in the exam or fail write this statement
var stuGrade =59
if (stu>50 ){
document.write("this stu is pass")
} else {
document.write("this stu is fial")
}
The switch statement is used to perform different actions based on different conditions.
switch(expression) {
  case x:
    // code block
    break;
  case y:
    // code block
    break;
  default:
    // code block
}
This is how it works:

The switch expression is evaluated once.
The value of the expression is compared with the values of each case.
If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed.
If there is no match, the default code block is executed.
