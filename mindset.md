**summraized about the mindset**

## A person's belief in personal qualities such as intelligence and talent, is it stable or growing?
### The growth mindset believes that a person's abilities grow through practice and work, and that intelligence and talent are the starting point, no more.

 ### A fixed mindset that believes in fatigue and work does not improve personal traits.
### For example, when you are faced with the challenges of a growth mindset, you embrace that challenge and try to solve it as opposed to a fixed mindset that tries to ignore it and forget it with something else.
