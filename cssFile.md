## BLOCK & INLINE ELEMENTS

CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. These rules govern
how the content of specified elements should be displayed. A CSS rule
contains two parts:**a selector** and a **declaration**.
### selectors are patterns used to select the element(s) you want to style.
### declarations separated by semicolons. Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon.
## example:

# color
Every color on a computer screen is created by mixing amounts of red,
green, and blue. To find the color you want, you can use a color picker.

The color property allows you to specify the color of text inside an element. You can specify any color in CSS in one of three ways:
1- write the name of color .
# h1 {
# color: DarkCyan;}
2-RGB :RGB color values are supported in all browsers,An RGB color value is specified with: rgb(red, green, blue).

4-Saturation: is the intensity of a hue from gray tone (no saturation) to pure, vivid color (high saturation).


5- Hue: refers to the origin of the colors we can see. Primary and Secondary colors (Yellow, Orange, Red, Violet, Blue, and Green) are considered hues; however, tertiary colors (mixed colors where neither color is dominant) would also be considered hues.


6-Brightness: is the relative lightness or darkness of a particular color, from black (no brightness) to white (full brightness). Brightness is also called Lightness in some contexts, in particular in SQL queries.
