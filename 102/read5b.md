## RULES FOR NAMING VARIABLES 
### Here are six rules you must always follow when giving a variable a name: 

 **The name must begin with a letter, dollar sign ($),or an underscore (_). It must not start with a number.**

**The name can contain letters, numbers, dollar sign ($), or an underscore (_). Note that you must not use a dash(-) or a period (.) in a variable name.**
**You cannot use keywords or reserved words**

**All variables are case sensitive means var age different from var AGE**

**the variable must refer to it content**

**if your variable name is made up of more than one word use the  camel case**

# ARRAYS .
## An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value; it stores a list of values.
 ### using an array whenever you are working with a list or a set of values that are related to each other. 
 ### If you don't know how many variables you want to create, create an array.
 ## create array
 ### This technique for creating an array is known as an array literal.

### you can see an array created using a different technique called an array constructor. This uses the new keyword followed by Array(); The values are then specified in parentheses (not square brackets), and each value is separated by a comma. You can also use a method called i tern() to retrieve data from the array.

## Each item in an array is
automatically given a number called an index. This can be used to access specific items in the array. Consider the following array which holds.
