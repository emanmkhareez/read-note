1-What is node.js?

Node. js is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast and scalable network applications. Node. js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.

2-In your own words, what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine?

Chrome V8 is a JavaScript engine, which means that it executes JavaScript code. Originally, JavaScript was written to be executed by web browsers. Chrome V8, or just V8, can execute JavaScript code either within or outside of a browser, which makes server-side scripting possible.

3-What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that achieves low latency and high throughput by taking a “non-blocking” approach to serving requests. In other words, Node.js wastes no time or resources on waiting for I/O requests to return.

4-What is npm?

npm is the world's largest Software Registry.

The registry contains over 800,000 code packages.

Open-source developers use npm to share software.

Many organizations also use npm to manage private development.

5-What version of npm are you running on your machine?

6-What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’?

npm install jshint

What is node used for?

Node.js is primarily used for non-blocking, event-driven servers, due to its single-threaded nature. It's used for traditional web sites and back-end API services, but was designed with real-time, push-based architectures in mind.

 ### pair programming is the practice of two developers sharing a single workstation to interactively tackle a coding task together. At Code Fellows, pair programing is one way we foster a collaborative environment while developing key industry skills.In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?

What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?

 1- Greater efficiency 

 2- Engaged collaboration

 3- Learning from fellow students
 
 4- Social skills

 5- Job interview readiness

 6- Work environment readiness

 In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?
 - Greater efficiency :
 because when work as pair become solving the problem faster than one programmer work and when sharing many way  to write code for example i learned another way to write  my code 

How does pair programming work?


While there are many different styles, pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator. The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. Handling the “mechanics” of coding, the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and—of course writing—code. The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer. The Navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted in to code, while scanning for typos or bugs. The Navigator might also utilize their computer as a second screen to look up solutions and documentation, but should not be writing any code.
