AWS: Cloud Servers
Review, Research, and Discussion
Describe the Web-Request-Response-Cycle?
The request/response cycle traces how a user's request flows through the app. Understanding the request/response cycle is helpful to figure out which files to edit when developing an app (and where to look when things aren't working).
Explain what a “server” is, as it relates to the WRRC? -It is a computer with more features,it treats client requests by organize and store data, then send a response to the client.
What does it mean to “deploy” an application?
Software deployment refers to the process of running an application on a server or device, and making the application work on a target device, whether it be a test server, production environment or a user's computer or mobile device.
Document the following Vocabulary Terms
Server: a server is a computer or system that provides resources, data, services, or programs to other computers, known as clients, over a network. In theory, whenever computers share resources with client machines they are considered servers.
Pub/Sub: -Pub/Sub is used for streaming analytics and data integration pipelines to ingest and distribute data. It is equally effective as messaging-oriented middleware for service integration or as a queue to parallelize tasks. -Pub/Sub enables you to create systems of event producers and consumers, called publishers and subscribers. Publishers communicate with subscribers asynchronously by broadcasting events, rather than by synchronous remote procedure calls (RPCs).
WRRC: Whole Request Response Cycle; it is a cycle of requests and responses that flow between clients and servers.

Virtual Machines
A Virtual Machine (VM) is a compute resource that uses software instead of a physical computer to run programs and deploy apps. ... Each virtual machine runs its own operating system and functions separately from the other VMs, even when they are all running on the same host.

VMS and the Cloud
Virtualization separates the hardware from physical machine to create multiple virtual machines on the same server while cloud gets build using multiple virtual infrastructures which combines the multiple virtualize applications/software/servers to create one instance for each application or software or server.

AWS EC2
An Amazon EC2 instance is a virtual server in Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) for running applications on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure. ... Amazon provides various types of instances with different configurations of CPU, memory, storage and networking resources to suit user needs
