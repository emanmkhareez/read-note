Compare and contrast Swagger and APIDoc.js 1 Which HTTP status codes should be sent with each type of (un)successful API call?

Swagger is a set of open-source tools built around the OpenAPI Specification that can help you design, build, document and consume REST APIs. The major Swagger tools include:

Swagger Editor – browser-based editor where you can write OpenAPI specs.
Swagger UI – renders OpenAPI specs as interactive API documentation.
Swagger Codegen – generates server stubs and client libraries from an OpenAPI spec.



Compare and contrast SOAP and ReST

The difference is: SOAP is a XML-based message protocol, while REST is an architectural style. SOAP uses WSDL for communication between consumer and provider, whereas REST just uses XML or JSON to send and receive data. SOAP invokes services by calling RPC


Web Server  :A web server is software and hardware that uses HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and other protocols to respond to client requests made over the World Wide Web. 

The main job of a web server is to display website content through storing, processing and delivering webpages to users. 

Web server hardware is connected to the internet and allows data to be exchanged with other connected devices, while web server software controls how a user accesses hosted files. The web server process is an example of the client/server model. All computers that host websites must have web server software.

Express :

Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications

Routing :
is the process of selecting a path for traffic in a network or between or across multiple networks.

What is a client?

A client is a piece of computer hardware or software that accesses a service made available by a server. Generally, clients are web browsers (like Chrome or Firefox), but clients can also be API’s making requests to another server or the command line (when making cURL requests).

What is an HTTP request?

A HTTP request is a text string generated by the client and sent to the server containing the specifications of the resource the client is asking for. A resource is anything that can accessed via the web. The HTTP request communicates which resource a client wants to interact with and how the client wants to interact with it, along with some metadata held in the header related to the request.

What is an HTTP response?

An HTTP response is what is sent by a server to a client in response to an HTTP request. These responses contain a status code and if the request was successful, the requested resource. An example status code for a successful request would be “200” and an example status code for an unsuccessful request would be “404”. Other common status codes include “300” for redirects and “500” for server errors.

hat happens once the client receives the HTTP response back from the server?

Once the client receives the HTTP response, the browser will render the HTTP response body message. This message is either the requested resource (for example, a web page) or display a message relating to status code if the request wasn’t successful.
