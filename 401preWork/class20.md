# Component Based UI

## A framework 

is  a set of tools and modules that can be reused for different projects. However, its use is mainly focused on the development of web applications.

## library

I always thought of a library as a set of objects and functions that focuses on solving a particular problem or a specific area of application development

## framework 

on the other hand as a collection of libraries centered on a particular methodology (i.e. **MVC**) and which covers all areas of application development.

# mvc

 It allows the developers to add structure to their applications easily and without much effort.

MVC consists of three components:

Models

Models are used for managing the data for an application. They are not concerned with the user-interface or presentation layers. Instead, they represent unique forms of data that an application may require. When a model is changed or updated, it will typically notify its observers about the change that has occurred so that they can act accordingly.


Views

Views are a visual representation of models that provide a filtered view of their current state. The JavaScript views are used for building and maintaining a DOM element. A view typically observes a model and is notified when the model changes, allowing the view to update itself accordingly. For

Controllers

Controllers act like intermediates between models and views, which are responsible for updating the model when the user manipulates the view. In the above example of our photo gallery application, a controller would be responsible for handling changes the user made to the edit view for a particular photo, updating a specific photo model when a user has finished editing.

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

Rendering:
The simple explanation is that rendering is the process of displaying something on a screen.


Templates: are frameworks for different data structures. Templates allows you to use standard data structures in your program without any need to write them yourself. Makes your code short and less complicated. A template is a blueprint or formula for creating a generic class or a function

state :

 In object-oriented programming, the state of an object is the combination of the original values in the object plus any modifications made to them.


## JSX(Javascript XML)

Enable the use of html tag inside javascript

it helps in making our writing code easier and faster it also make to use expression to view data
